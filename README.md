This repo and website are designed to enable the most frictionless experience for developing software that relies on JSON-LD.

By default, any undocumented property will be labled as deprecated, do not use.

We are aiming to cover 100% of the vocabulary used by:

- https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1
- https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1

### Contexts

#### [Security v1](https://identity.foundation/context/security-v1)

#### [Security v2](https://identity.foundation/context/security-v1)

#### [DID v1](https://identity.foundation/context/did-v1)

#### [DID Latest](https://identity.foundation/context/did-latest)

This context defines all vocabularly used with decentralized identifiers. This includes terms used by verifiable credentials.
